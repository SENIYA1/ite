        <P>Paris, the city of light, is known for its historical landmarks, and beautiful
            streets.</P>
        <P>It's a place where art, culture, and fashion thrive.</P>
        <P> I love the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre
            Museum, and the charming caf√©s.</P>

        <P>Impressive, exciting, colourful, mighty and tragic: Nuremberg has reflected German history since the Middle
            Ages. </P>
        <P> Protected by the castle, a new spirit enlivened the city at a time when few other places could offer such a
            quality of life.</P>
        <P> And the same is still true today.</P>
